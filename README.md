Bruh dis dumb...
...BUT IT WORKS FUCK YOUUUU

Yeah this is a pathfinding algorithm, resembling the Dijkstra pathfinding algo.
It's written in Python, doesn't actually serve a purpose, just prints out a path.
I'd say it could serve for education purposes, but its poorly commented ;(.
Feel free to use it in whatever, if you find a use from it.
